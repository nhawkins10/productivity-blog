# Productivity Blog

This is my blog about various productivity topics with tips, tricks, hacks, methods, tools and more. I really enjoy learning new productivity methods and finding new tools to use. I started this blog as a place where I could record the things that I've found and share them with other people. 

This blog uses Jekyll for templating and is served on Github. To get started:
- clone the repo
- start the Jekyll server with _jekyll serve_
- serve drafts with _jekyll serve -D_
